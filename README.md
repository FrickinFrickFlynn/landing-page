This is a project for ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## Description
The assignment is to create a replica webpage of the following image:
![image of the webpage](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
This will be done with HTML and CSS (Flexbox) only. 
While the webpage I make should look like this I am allowed to have some creative freedom. 
It also does not have to be an exact one-to-one replica.

## Reflection
Ok. This project was a little frustrating, but (of course) I felt that I learned a lot by
taking my time on it. I did not add too much personalization to the webpage. I only
changed the default content to some pictures and text about my pets.

The hardest part of the project had to be figuring out how to organize the flexboxes and
get them to cooperate the way I would like. Although I would say that flexboxes were very
convenient and simple when they worked without a fuss. Definetly going to use them on my 
own personal projects in the future.

Overall, the project was enjoyable and simple too.
