This is a project for ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## Decscription
The assignment is to create a replica webpage of the following image:
![image of the webpage](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
This will be done with HTML and CSS (Flexbox) only. 
While the webpage I make should look like this I am allowed to have some creative freedom. 
It also does not have to be an exact one-to-one replica.

## Reflection
To be filled out once the project is finished.
